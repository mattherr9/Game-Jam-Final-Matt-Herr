I went through a journey trying to make the theme of this project work. It was far from my first choice, and was in fact, one of my last. I went through several ideas and tests before settling on this one: a 2d platformer of sentient atoms trying to bond to create water. Quite a literal sense of everything (atoms, which make up everything) being alive. 

Use A and D, or the arrow keys to move left or right. Use SPACE to jump. Like all 2D platformers, make it to the end of the stage to progress. There are 3 levels, and will automatically loop back to the first level after the third level is completed. 

No external Unity store assets were used.
